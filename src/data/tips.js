    summary: 'Essential vaccinations and health tips for East African travel.',
    content: `Before traveling to East Africa, consult a travel health clinic 6-8 weeks before departure. Recommended vaccinations typically include Yellow Fever (mandatory for some countries), Hepatitis A & B, Typhoid, and routine vaccinations.

    Malaria prevention is crucial – East Africa has malaria transmission year-round in most areas. Consult your doctor about antimalarial medication and take precautions: use DEET-based repellent, sleep under treated mosquito nets, and wear long sleeves/pants at dawn and dusk.

    Carry a well-stocked first aid kit including rehydration salts, anti-diarrheal medication, and any prescription medicines you need. Drink only bottled or purified water, and be cautious with ice and uncooked foods.

    Travel insurance with medical evacuation coverage is essential – healthcare facilities vary significantly across the region, and serious conditions may require evacuation to Nairobi or beyond.`,

    title: 'Essential Packing List for Safari',
    summary: 'What to pack for the ultimate East African adventure.',
    content: `Safari packing requires balancing comfort, practicality, and airline luggage restrictions. Most safari operators use small aircraft with strict weight limits (usually 15-20kg including hand luggage), so pack in soft-sided duffel bags rather than hard suitcases.

    Clothing should be neutral-colored (khaki, olive, tan, brown) – avoid bright colors and white, which can startle animals and show dirt. Layers are essential as temperatures vary significantly from cool early mornings to hot midday. A warm fleece or jacket is crucial for open-vehicle game drives.

    Essential gear includes quality binoculars (8x42 or 10x42), a good camera with zoom lens (at least 200mm), plenty of memory cards and batteries, and sun protection including a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and high-SPF sunscreen.

    Don't forget practical items: headlamp/flashlight, power adapters (UK-style plugs in East Africa), and a small daypack. Laundry services are available at most lodges, so you can pack light.`,

    title: 'Wildlife Viewing Etiquette',
    summary: 'Maximize wildlife encounters while respecting nature.',
    content: `Responsible wildlife viewing ensures both safety and conservation. Always follow your guide's instructions – they understand animal behavior and know how to keep you safe.

    Keep quiet during game viewing – loud noises disturb animals and reduce everyone's experience. Speak in low tones and avoid sudden movements. Stay in the vehicle unless at designated spots – wild animals see vehicles as non-threatening, but a human shape can trigger defensive or predatory responses.

    Never feed wildlife or litter – human food disrupts natural behaviors and can lead to dangerous habituation. Plastic and other waste can harm or kill animals.

    For primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, maintain the required distance (7 meters for gorillas), don't visit if you're ill (primates are susceptible to human diseases), and minimize flash photography.

    Early morning and late afternoon offer the best wildlife activity – plan your game drives accordingly.`,
    tips: [
      'Always stay in the vehicle unless directed',
      'Keep quiet and move slowly',
      'Never feed or approach wildlife',
      'Maintain distance from primates',
      'Plan drives for early morning and late afternoon'

    summary: 'Navigate East African cultures with respect and sensitivity.',
    content: `East Africa's cultural diversity enriches any visit, but requires awareness and respect. Always ask permission before photographing people – in many communities, photography has spiritual or cultural significance, and payment may be expected.

    Dress modestly, especially in Muslim areas and rural communities. For women, this means covering shoulders and knees; for men, long trousers are often more appropriate than shorts. In coastal areas and Zanzibar, conservative dress is particularly important.

    Learn a few words of Swahili (or the local language) – greetings are important in East African culture. "Jambo" (hello), "Asante" (thank you), and "Karibu" (welcome) go a long way in building rapport.

    When visiting communities or villages, go with a local guide who can facilitate respectful interaction and ensure community benefit. Purchase crafts directly from artisans when possible.

    Public displays of affection are generally frowned upon, and same-sex relationships are legally prohibited in most East African countries.`,

    title: 'Money and Tipping Guide',
    summary: 'Managing finances and understanding tipping culture.',
    content: `US Dollars are widely accepted throughout East Africa for tourist services, but local currency is needed for small purchases and local transport. Carry clean, post-2006 bills – older or damaged notes may be rejected.

    ATMs are available in major cities but can be unreliable – carry sufficient cash for your needs, especially in rural areas. Credit cards are accepted at upmarket hotels and restaurants but carry backup cash.

    Tipping is expected in the tourism industry and forms a significant part of staff income. Guidelines: Safari guides $15-20 per guest per day, camp/lodge staff $10-15 per guest per day (pooled), trackers $10-20 for gorilla/chimp treks, restaurant servers 10-15% of bill.

    Bargaining is expected in markets but approach it with humor and respect – an aggressive approach is counterproductive. Start around 50% of the asking price and work toward a mutually acceptable figure.`,

      'Carry new, clean US Dollar bills',
      'Budget for tipping (significant cost)',
      'Have local currency for small purchases',

    summary: 'Transportation options and tips for travel in the region.',
    content: `Internal flights are often the most practical way to cover East Africa's large distances, especially between parks. Book flights well in advance during peak season, and be prepared for small aircraft with strict baggage limits.

    Road travel varies dramatically by country and region. Main highways are generally good, but park roads can be rough, especially during rainy season. 4x4 vehicles are essential for safari and many rural areas. Self-driving is possible for experienced drivers but challenging due to road conditions, signage, and driving styles.

    Cross-border travel requires proper documentation – visas for each country and potentially East African tourist visas for Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. Some border crossings are straightforward; others require patience.

    Public transport (buses, matatus/minibuses, boda-boda motorbikes) is available but not recommended for tourists unfamiliar with the systems. Private transfers or organized tours are safer and more comfortable alternatives.`,

    summary: 'Everything you need to know for a successful gorilla trek.',
    content: `Gorilla trekking is East Africa's premier wildlife experience, requiring physical preparation and advance planning. Permits sell out months ahead – book as early as possible, especially for Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park.

    Physical fitness matters – treks can last 1-8 hours through steep, muddy terrain at altitude. Prepare with cardio exercise and hiking in the months before your trip. Hire a porter – they support local employment, carry your bag, and assist on difficult terrain.

    Essential gear includes waterproof hiking boots with good ankle support, waterproof jacket and trousers, gardening gloves for grabbing vegetation, long sleeves and trousers (for nettles and ants), and layers for variable weather.

    On trek day, maintain the 7-meter distance from gorillas, don't eat or drink near them, turn away if you need to sneeze or cough, and follow guide instructions exactly. The hour with a gorilla family passes quickly – savor every moment.`,

    title: 'Best Time to Visit East Africa',
    summary: 'Understand seasons and timing for optimal experiences.',
    content: `East Africa has two main seasons: dry seasons (June-October and January-February) and wet seasons (March-May and November-December). The dry seasons are generally best for wildlife viewing as animals concentrate around water sources and vegetation is thinner for better visibility.

    The Great Migration timing varies: calving season in southern Serengeti (January-March), river crossings in northern Tanzania/Maasai Mara (July-October). The spectacle moves constantly, so consult with operators about current locations.

    Gorilla trekking is year-round, though dry seasons mean easier hiking. Highland areas like the Simien Mountains and Rwenzori are best in dry season for trekking.

    Peak season (July-October, December-February) means higher prices and more visitors, but also best weather and wildlife. Shoulder seasons offer good experiences with fewer crowds and lower prices. Green season (wet) brings lower prices, fewer tourists, lush landscapes, and excellent birding, but some roads may be challenging.`,

      'Dry seasons (Jun-Oct, Jan-Feb) best for wildlife',
      'Great Migration timing varies by month',
      'Book peak season (Jul-Oct) well ahead',
      'Consider shoulder seasons for value',
